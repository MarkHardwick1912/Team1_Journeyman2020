Dummy's Guide To The Unreal Build

WHICH VERSION TO USE
Firstly, When testing any new Mechanics/Systems in the build do it in a copied version of the BUILD VERSION
from the GitHub.

LOADING IN
The Project loads into a base Motion Controller Test Level, this contains the VR controller Pawn which can be moved to 
other created levels in the future.

FILE SYSTEM
The files in the CONTENT folder are colour coded:

	YELLOW: These are the VR template files, they house the VR Pawn and Motion Controller Blueprints as well as the 
	meshes and animations required for them

	BLUE: Designer Files

	RED: Artist Files

	PURPLE: Files from the Character Team

	GREEN: Files from the Animation Team

The file system can be expanded upon when files are being uploaded to the master build

IMPORTING FILES
When importing files into the unreal editor go through this checklist:

	1. If a folder suitable for the type of file you are uploading does not exist in the file system create
	   one for your file type

	2. If uploading multiple files for the same item i.e textures for an asset, place all of these into a single folder
           you create

	3. Follow the same naming convention that is layed out below

NAMING CONVENTION
The naming convention of all files should follow this layout:

	1. A prefix for the type of file you are uploading e.g. BP (Blueprint), SM (Static Mesh)
           
	2. A name for the file you have imported e.g. VRController

	3. Finally, end the name with your initials

All three of these should have an underscore between them leading the a title such as:
BP_VRController_MH
